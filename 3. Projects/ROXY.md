A simple tool to generate a HYROX-style workout.

Some basic inputs:
- Quarter, Half, Full
- Light, Normal, Hard

Then generates a list of routines to follow, which includes:
- Running lap count and distance
- Stations and rep count/distance per station

❓Need to think about the kind of stations because not all equipment might be available.
💡Maybe ask Coach for input?
