A simple tool to generate a HYROX-style workout.

Some basic inputs:
- Quarter, Half, Full
- Light, Normal, Hard

Then generates a list of routines to follow, which includes:
- Cycle count
- Running distance per cycle
- Stations
- Reps per station

❓Need to think about the kind of stations because not all equipment is available.
💡Maybe collaborate with Coach?
