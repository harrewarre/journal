## Idea
Write an E-Guide that describes a collection of principles for Platform engineering.
## Context
For software development there are the 12-factor principles that are a great guidance for writing cloud native apps.

What if we write a similar document that describes a set of principles that can be used for platform engineering. The two disciplines are in some ways similar, so there should be some overlap, but surely we can come up with some guidance that is specifically tailored to platform engineers.

We would need input from most if not all of the CNA team for this because we need many different angles to come to the core of the principles that we want to put forward.
## Why?
We want to let the world know that ITQ "gets" platform engineering and that we are serious about it. A guide that caters directly to platform engineers (and maybe CTOs?) would go a long way in showing that we know what we're talking about.
## Format
- Pizza session at the office?
- Work@Office day content?
- Maybe people can work on this in their own time in a shared document?

It will probably take a few iterations to fully flesh everything out but my hunch is that we can get a good amount of stuff down in one session of a few hours. We also have a great example in the original 12-factor document.

## Notes
See for example https://cnoe.io which seems to go in a similar direction with a list of practices and ways of working.

Desired state!
