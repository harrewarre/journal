## ~~Balanced Team~~
You MUST have all disciplines in your team.
Silos work just fine.
## ~~Product Mindset~~
Building software in isolation is a recipe for success.
Early feedback is essential.
## ~~The 10-minute build~~
Who needs fast builds when you only release once every 4 months.
"Move fast and break stuff".
## ~~Golden paths~~
Product teams should not be dealing with how to deploy software.
Even more standards?!
## ~~Platform as a product~~
(See product mindset!)
Your platform is a means to an end.
You know what services the dev teams should use.
## ~~Pair programming~~
Four eyes is better than two.
Two people working on the same thing is expensive.
# Bonus topics, om wat te kiezen te hebben 🙂

## Ownership
Do you do as the organisation demands.
You own your backlog and priorities.

## ~~Test driven development~~
(Testing is important regardles)
Test first?
Test After?
Only a few large tests?
Lots of small tests?
??

## Big design up front
You know exactly what is needed now and in the future.
You design just enough to get started.
(Architecture is really important here)
