Sander Harrewijnen helps teams build better software. By day he’s an Application Modernization Technologist at ITQ, where he works with organizations that want to modernize their applications, platforms, and ways of working. In practice, that means guiding teams through the shift to cloud-native, improving developer experience, and making sure technology actually helps people get their work done instead of slowing them down.

On his personal site, harre.dev Sander shares blog posts about software engineering practices, cloud platforms, and the messy, human side of tech. He’s also the co-host of the **Cloud Native Chronicles** podcast, a show that mixes architecture, DevOps, product thinking, and culture into short, approachable episodes. His goal with both writing and podcasting is the same: to make modern software development a little less overwhelming and a lot more practical.

Sander believes that great technology only works when the teams building it are set up for success. He’s especially interested in how balanced teams, platform engineering, and autonomy can make developers happier and more productive. Over the years, he’s seen how small changes—better feedback loops, less friction in developer tooling, or clearer product goals—can unlock big improvements in how teams deliver.

Some of his favorite topics to speak about include:

- Moving from legacy to cloud-native without losing your sanity
- Building platforms that developers actually want to use
- Team structures that encourage autonomy and ownership
- How product thinking and DevOps go hand-in-hand
- The role of experimentation in modern software engineering

When he’s not working or speaking, you’ll probably find Sander writing, gaming, or exploring new ideas to bring back into his talks and blog. He’s always up for a conversation about tech, teams, or even the latest game he’s playing—so don’t hesitate to say hi after his session.
