**Build toward the idea of a maturity model**—one that’s used to assess an organization’s strengths and identify high-impact modernization opportunities.

This structure still supports a **lightboard delivery**, with segments broad enough for elaboration but tightly focused on leading to your **discovery engagement offering** centered around the maturity model.

## 🎬 **Video Structure: “Modernizing Software Delivery: A Path Forward”**

**Length**: 4–5 minutes  
**Format**: Lightboard-friendly  
**Tone**: Advisor/consultant guiding a thoughtful transformation  
**Goal**: Lead the viewer to your discovery engagement anchored in a maturity model

### 🔹 **1. The Challenge of Legacy Environments**

**Script Concept**:

- "Many organizations still rely on legacy, on-prem environments."
    
- "These systems can be reliable—but they’re often brittle, slow to change, and costly to evolve."
    
- "Meanwhile, the pace of digital expectations keeps accelerating."
    

✅ **Visual idea**: Draw a “legacy stack” (e.g., monolith, manual deploys, siloed ops). Label pain points: _slow releases_, _long feedback loops_, _infrastructure bottlenecks_.

---

### 🔹 **2. Modernization Is More Than ‘Cloud’**

**Script Concept**:

- "Modernizing isn’t just about moving workloads to the cloud."
    
- "It’s about rethinking how software is built, delivered, and operated."
    
- "That’s where cloud-native thinking comes in: platforms, practices, and teams all evolving together."
    

✅ **Visual idea**: Side-by-side view:  
"Legacy Platform" → "Cloud-Native Platform"  
"Ticket-driven Dev" → "Empowered Dev Teams"

### 🔹 **3. Three Pillars of Modernization**

Frame this section around **three foundational areas** your maturity model evaluates:

1. **Platform** – “How consistent, scalable, and automated is your software platform?”
    
2. **Practices** – “Are your teams using modern engineering methods—like CI/CD, trunk-based dev, observability?”
    
3. **Ways of Working** – “How are your teams structured? Are they empowered by the platform, or blocked by it?”
    

✅ **Visual idea**: A triangle with three labeled sides:  
`Platform`, `Practices`, `Ways of Working`  
You’ll return to this visual in the conclusion.

### 🔹 **4. Why a Maturity Model Matters**

**Script Concept**:

- "Every organization starts from a different place."
    
- "That’s why we use a maturity model—to help you identify where you’re strong, and where you’ll get the highest return from modernizing."
    
- "Some orgs have solid platforms but need to evolve their ways of working. Others have agile teams, but fragile infrastructure."
    

✅ **Visual idea**:  
A radar chart (spider diagram) with sample dimensions:

- Deployment Frequency
    
- Mean Time to Recovery
    
- Infrastructure Consistency
    
- Developer Autonomy
    
- Observability
    
- Security Posture
    

Draw two shaded areas: _Current State_ vs. _Target State_.

### 🔹 **5. How We Help: Pathfinder ~~Discovery Engagement**

**Script Concept**:

- “We start with a discovery engagement based on this maturity model.”
    
- “We collaborate with your teams to uncover what’s working well—and what’s holding you back.”
    
- “You’ll get a clear, actionable path forward, prioritized by impact and effort.”
    

✅ **Visual idea**:  
Draw a 3-step path:  
**1. Assess** → **2. Identify Leverage Points** → **3. Recommend Interventions**

Bullet ideas:

- Technical platform evaluation
    
- Practice maturity workshops
    
- Team interviews
    
- Roadmap aligned to your business goals

### 🔹 **6. Call to Action**

**Script Concept**:

- “Modernization isn’t a product you buy—it’s a capability you grow.”
    
- “Whether you’re cloud-first or still fully on-prem, we’ll help you take the next best step.”
    
- “Let’s uncover the most impactful ways to modernize—together.”
    

✅ **Visual idea**:  
Return to the triangle: Platform, Practices, Ways of Working.  
Wrap with a clear invitation:  
**“Start with a discovery engagement. Build your modernization roadmap.”**
