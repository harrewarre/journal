Developer advocacy is a role that is a change for developers, not for people coming from HR, PR or marketing. Your main job is still to develop – but this time examples, training materials and explanatory demos rather than live products.

## Find your role and play to your strengths

Not everybody can and should be an all-around developer advocate. It is enough if you find your place in the whole spectrum of advocacy. Think about what you love to do the most and then start creating something. The most common parts of the whole job to go into are:

- Writing code tutorials
- Blogging
- Public speaking
- Training
- Social web coverage
- Streaming
- Community support

---

In order to have an impact in the company and to get things changed you have to take your hands off the keyboard and start talking and persuading.

---

Your independence and your integrity is your main power. If you lost it you are not effective any longer. People should get excited about what you do because they trust your judgment – not because you work for a certain company.

Much Content / Talks / Be good engineer - Pick 2.
