## "Cloud-native pathfinder"

Provide a standardized ITQ practice (?) we can all build on and can present to customers when the need for one of the following topics is touched:

- Cloud native platform (PaaS)
- Developer Experience
- Cloud native way of working

Maybe has a link to the "ITQ Architecture series" (which takes the same approach).
(See also: CNCF Trailmap)

Goal: Long-term collaboration with client about above topics.

Hints from orgs about opportunity:
- How do we become "cloud native".
- Have a platform but not sure where to go next.
- Want a platform but not sure where to start.
- Legacy apps headache.
- Slow time-to-market.
- High defect rates
