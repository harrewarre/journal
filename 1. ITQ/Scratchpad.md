## Vibecoding abstract

In the vibecoding session you will get a good look at what vibe coding is from various angles.
I have some insights for you from my experience at clients that are using ChatGPT as a means to build production software. You will learn about some of the dangers of using ChatGPT for your coding needs and some funny examples from the real world where people assumed everything was fine until it wasn't. We'll have a quick look at productivity implications with the current state of technology and to top it off there will be a live coding session where we build a small application without writing any code ourselves!
