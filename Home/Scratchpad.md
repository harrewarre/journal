The key word in platform engineering isn’t “platform”; it’s “engineering.” Solid engineering is needed to move up the abstraction ladder, as Yevgeniy Brikman has said.

Platform engineering is necessarily opinionated: platform engineers need to develop ideas about how software development workflows should be handled.

Platform engineering is necessarily an attempt to impose some kind of order on a chaotic situation

Golden paths

If senior management thinks that platform engineering doesn’t contribute directly to the product, they need to be educated in what it means to ship a software product. They need to understand that there is no product without deployment, without testing, without provisioning infrastructure. Doing this infrastructure work more efficiently and effectively contributes directly to the product. A product that can’t be deployed—or where deployments take months rather than hours—is dead in the water.

# If you are useful, it doesn’t mean you are valued

“ I distinguish four types. There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.“ - General and Commander-in-Chief Weimar Republic [https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord)
