## Ignition Works is an ecosystem for entrepreneurial success.
The purpose of Ignition Works is to grow an ecosystem of contributors that thrives by exercising each of our areas of excellence to achieve entrepreneurial success.

As contributors, we apply our areas of excellence in endeavours that interest us, deliver value to our customers, and build repeatable, scalable and profitable business models.

Profitable since our start in 2017, we grow organically without venture capital pressure. We share the benefit of success as it arrives by paying a generous combination of salaries and equity stake in future profits.
## Ignition Works succeeds as a cohesive team of capable contributors crafting a mature, productive and fulfilling work environment built on our diverse strengths.
We all receive the same pay, an annual gross salary of £120k.

We each set our own working hours, unpaid pre-planned leave, and what tools the company buys for us. We primarily work remotely with some on-site consulting.

We continuously realign our spheres of responsibility – adjusting for each of our
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances – to maximise our effectiveness, encourage personal growth and remove static managerial hierarchy.
## Ignition Works develops products and provides consulting services.
Our consulting is focused on operating PaaS platforms, delivering software and teaching engineering practices.

Our product development initiatives aim to create scalable, repeatable and profitable business models that address pain points revealed by our consulting work.
## Ignition Works is looking for a diversity of team members.
We seek people with skills to lead, humility to contribute when others lead, and
kindness to value different perspectives. We are pursuing diverse backgrounds and experiences to expand the team’s insight. Accordingly, we strive to make adjustments that enable team members to succeed.
## Ignition Works hires people rather than fills roles.
As we grow we need contributors with a broad range of skills. We start a conversation with candidates independent of their skill set. First we figure out if the fit is right, then together we find when the time is right for them to join Ignition Works.
